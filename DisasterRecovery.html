		<p>What is Disaster Recovery?</p>
              
                <p>Disaster Recovery is the primary insurance strategy for protecting data centers From natural or human made disasters. 
                  Disaster recovery is to make sire that a business can quicklu resume operations ro maintain mission critical functions 
                  duringor after a disaster. THe disaster recovery process includes planning and tesing and mayinvolve a separate physical
                  site for recovery operations. 
		</p>
    <p>What can we better understand the disaster recovery?</p>
              <p> First, we can define disaster from a business continuity perspective that we can find in any situation that puts an 
                organization operation at risk. For example: when data loss, human error, natural disaster and hardware and software failures and more.
                -Natural disaster
                -Cyber attack 
                -Human error 
                -Machine and hardware failures
    </p>
     <p>How can we prevent those situation?</p>
              <p> We can use a third-party provider to replicate and host servers in a separate data center, but when a disaster strikes, the goal of
                any disater recovery plan is to ensure the operation run as normally as possible.
                Benefits of disaster recovery: 
                -Improve safety concern
                -Recovery faster
                -Lower cost
                -More professional
                
    </p>
              <p> The two main goals of disaster recovery are to return affected sytems to an operational state as quickly as possible and to minimize data
                loss after a catastrophic event or planned outage. The measurements of htese two primary goals are called recovery time objective (RTO) and 
                recovery point objective (RPO)
