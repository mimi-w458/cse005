                <h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
                <h3>What is Disaster Recovery?</h3>
                <p>Disaster Recovery is the primary insurance strategy for protecting data centers from natural or human-made disasters. It ensures that a business can quickly resume operations or maintain mission-critical functions during or after a disaster. The disaster recovery process includes planning and testing and may involve a separate physical site for recovery operations.</p>

                <h3>How can we better understand disaster recovery?</h3>
                <p>From a business continuity perspective, a disaster is any situation that puts an organization's operations at risk. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Natural disasters</li>
                    <li>Cyber attacks</li>
                    <li>Human errors</li>
                    <li>Machine and hardware failures</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How can we prevent these situations?</h3>
                <p>One way is by using a third-party provider to replicate and host servers in a separate data center. When a disaster strikes, the goal of any disaster recovery plan is to ensure operations run as normally as possible.</p>
                
                <h4>Benefits of Disaster Recovery:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved safety</li>
                    <li>Faster recovery</li>
                    <li>Lower costs</li>
                    <li>Professional expertise</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The two main goals of disaster recovery are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Returning affected systems to an operational state as quickly as possible.</li>
                    <li>Minimizing data loss after a catastrophic event or planned outage.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These goals are measured by two key metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recovery Time Objective (RTO):</strong> How quickly systems can be restored.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery Point Objective (RPO):</strong> How much data loss is acceptable.</li>
                </ul>
